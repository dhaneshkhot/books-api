# Demo APIs - books-api to demonstrate Unit Tests, Integration Tests, and Web Integration Tests.

Idea is to cover all the tests at lower level of Test Pyramid which will help for Continuous Integration and Continous Delpoyment.

In order to run the tests, just clone the repo, resolve maven dependencies and run 'mvn clean install'.
